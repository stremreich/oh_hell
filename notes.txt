basic game tructure done!

TODO: add an automatic suite of plots/analysis to the testing function rather than just csv -> excel

TODO: create a way to get game stats for a large number of games
	- generalize the verbosity option better

TODO: Generalize bid, card picking AI to functions
	- pick_bid(Player, trump_card)
	- play_card(Player, trump_card)
	- can add info (such as played cards, etc. using python function args method)
	- could make AI-specific class (RandAI, TrickAI, etc.)
		- then give each class the above two functions
		- then when creating a Player, give them a brain that is that AI class
		- then have them call the universal functions from their "brain"
		- class inheritance
	- AIs:
		- RandAI: already implemented, "base" AI
		- TrickAI: more or less copy trickster cards oh hell AI
			- bid = Aces+trump
			- if below bid or above bid:
				- play worst card that will win trick if possible
					- do a basic card ranking (trump > suit > non-suit)
				- else play worst card
		- CountAI: card counting AI
			- keep track of played cards
			- calculate card strength by number of un-played cards that could beat it
			- may not even make this one...
