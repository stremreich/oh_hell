tricks:
	The tricks could be handled with a list of player/card tuples rather than just a list of cards for the played cards.
	You could then have dealer/leader ITERATORS that you could re-define from the starting point of the person who won the last trick for each susequent trick
		Basically you would make an cycle iterator starting from the lead player for the first trick
		Then you evaluate the trick and add the score, and REMAKE a list from the cycle iterator, starting at the new leader's index
	The dealer iterator can just be simply iterated via itertools.cycle
	Potentially also keep trick score this way...
