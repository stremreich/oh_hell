how to implement scoring:
- need to keep track of trick score and game score
- game score is in the player class already
- could add trick score as well, would need to be reset at the end of a hand (or beginning of new hand)
	- could reset trick scores when dealing...
- OR could change the bids list to be a tuple of trick score and bids...
